# rachit-cc
A toy compiler for a simplified imperative language (SIL) written Rust.

Here is an example of a SIL program that recursively 
calculates the Fibonacci numbers:
```python
# Compute the x'th Fibonacci number.
def fib(x) {
  if (x < 3) {
    return 1
  }
  else {
    return fib(x-1)+fib(x-2)
  }
}

# This expression will compute the 40th number.
fib(40)
```
*Visualized with Python syntax highlighting for readability*

And here are all the supported keywords in SIL:

```def if else while return break continue int bool void true```

## Planned Features
- Handwritten table/switch driven lexer (also known as a *scanner* or *tokenizer*) âœ…
- Handwritten Recursive Descent parser
- Code generation to ARM assembly
- Language support for floating point numbers, basic arithmetic operators, mutable variables, function definitions and calls, conditionals, and while loops.
- Optimizations like trivial constant folding (to-do: flesh out all optimizations)
- 100% unit test coverage

## Low-Priority Future Improvements
- Support for more data types other than floating points (like booleans, integers, and strings)
- A backend for LLVM / interfacing with the LLVM API to generate optimized IR

## Sources
The syntax is loosely inspired by the Decaf language reference used in CS 432 and CS 630 at James Madison University.
